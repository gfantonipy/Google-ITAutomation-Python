### Key Terms
Programming code - Programming code is a set of written computer instructions, guided by rules, using a computer programming language. It might help to think of the computer instructions as a detailed, step-by-step recipe for performing tasks. The instructions tell computers and machines how to perform an action. Programming code may also be referred to as source code or scripts.

**Programming languages** - Programming languages are similar to human spoken languages in that they both use syntax and semantics. Programming languages are used to write computer programs.  Some common programming languages include Python, Java, C, C++, C#, and R.

**Syntax** - Syntax is a set of rules for how statements are constructed in both human and computer languages. Programming syntax includes rules for the order of elements in programming instructions, as well as the use of special characters and their placements in statements. This concept is similar to the syntax rules for grammar and punctuation in human language.

**Semantics** - Semantics refers to the intended meaning or effect of statements, or collections of words, in both human and computer languages. Semantic errors are also referred to as logical errors.

Computer program - A computer program is a step-by-step list of instructions that a computer follows to reach an intended goal. It is important to be clear and precise about the actions a computer program is supposed to perform because computers will do exactly what they are instructed to do. Computer programs can be long, complex, and accomplish a variety of tasks. They are often developed by computer programmers and software engineers, but anyone can learn to create them. Computer programs may involve a structured development cycle. They can be written in a wide variety of programming languages, such as Python, Java, C++,  R, and more. The completed format of a program is often a single executable file.

Script - Scripts are usually shorter and less complex than computer programs. Scripts are often used to automate specific tasks. However, they can be used for complex tasks if needed. Scripts are often written by IT professionals, but anyone can learn to write scripts. Scripts have a shorter, less structured development cycle as compared to the development of complex computer programs and software. Scripts can be written in a variety of programming languages, like Python, Javascript, Ruby, Bash, and more. Some scripting languages are interpreted languages and are only compatible with certain platforms.

Automation - Automation is used to replace a repetitive manual step with one that happens automatically. 

Output - Output is the end result of a task performed by a function or computer program. Output can include a single value, a report, entries into a database, and more. 

Input - Input is information that is provided to a program by the end user. Input can be text, voice, images, biometrics, and more.   

Functions - A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task.

Variables - Variables are used to temporarily store changeable values in programming code.

More About Python
Using Python on your own
The best way to learn any programming language is to practice it on your own as much as you can. If you have Python installed on your computer, you can execute the interpreter by running the python3 command (or just python on Windows), and you can close it by typing exit() or Ctrl-D.

If you don’t already have Python installed on your machine, that’s alright. We’ll explain how to install it in an upcoming course.

Python practice resources
In the meantime, you can still practice by using one of the many online Python interpreters or codepads available online. There’s not much difference between an interpreter and a codepad. An interpreter is more interactive than a codepad, but they both let you execute code and see the results.

Below, you’ll find links to some of the most popular online interpreters and codepads. Give them a go to find your favorite.

Additional Python resources
While this course will give you information about how Python works and how to write scripts in Python, you’ll likely want to find out more about specific parts of the language. Here are some great ways to help you find additional info: 

Read the official Python documentation.

Search for answers or ask a question on Stack Overflow. 

Subscribe to the Python tutor mailing list, where you can ask questions and collaborate with other Python learners.

Subscribe to the Python-announce mailing list to read about the latest updates in the language.

Python history and current status
Python was released almost 30 years ago and has a rich history. You can read more about it on the History of Python Wikipedia page or in the section on the history of the software from the official Python documentation.

Python has recently been called the fastest growing programming language. If you're interested in why this is and how it’s measured, you can find out more in these articles:

Platform-specific / OS specific scripting language - Platform-specific scripting languages, like PowerShell (for Windows) and Bash (for Linux), are used by system administrators on those platforms. 

Client-side scripting language - Client-side scripting languages, like JavaScript, are used mostly for web programming. The scripts are transferred from a web server to the end-user’s internet browser, then executed in the browser.

Machine language - Machine language is the lowest-level computer language. It communicates directly with computing machines in binary code (ones and zeros). In binary code, one equals a pulse of electricity and zero equals no electrical pulse. Machine language instructions are made from translating languages like Python into complex patterns of ones and zeros. 

Cross-platform language - Programming language that is compatible with one or more platforms / operating systems (e.g., Windows, Linux, Mac, iOS, Android).

Object-oriented programming language - In object-oriented programming languages, most coding elements are considered to be objects with configurable properties. For example, a form field is an object that can be configured to accept only dates as input in the mm/dd/yy format, and can be configured to read from and write to a specific database. 

Python interpreter - An interpreter is the program that reads and executes Python code by translating Python code into computer instructions.
